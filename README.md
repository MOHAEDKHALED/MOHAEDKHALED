# Hi, I'm Mohamed Khaled Idris

### AI Engineer & Full-Stack .NET Developer | Agentic AI & Automation Specialist

Hey there! I'm a versatile engineer who loves mixing AI, machine learning, and full-stack dev to build cool, scalable solutions. With roots in software engineering and data science, I focus on creating apps that boost efficiency, automate stuff, and make a real difference with smart AI and solid backends.

## What I Build
- AI and machine learning models (ML, DL, Computer Vision, Predictive Analytics) 
- Agentic AI systems using CrewAI, LangChain, and RAG architectures 
- Automation workflows (n8n, multi-agent pipelines, procurement and CRM tools) 
- Full-stack applications (.NET backend, Angular frontend, RESTful APIs) 
- Data-driven platforms (recommendation engines, dashboards, e-commerce solutions)
